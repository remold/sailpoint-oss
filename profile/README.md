We understand that Identity at scale can, many times, require development. Over
time you will find a great deal of technical resources here for extending your
SailPoint platform.

Great things to come very soon! In the mean time, to learn more, checkout the
[Developer Community](https://developer.sailpoint.com/) or join the discussion
with other developers in the
[Developer Community forum](https://developer.sailpoint.com/discuss) to talk
about extending our platform, using the our tools, and more!
