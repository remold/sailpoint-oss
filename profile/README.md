We understand that identity at scale can, many times, require development. Over
time you will find a great deal of technical resources in our GitHub for
extending your SailPoint platform. We will continue to provide tools to help you
in this endeavour, and those tools will be open source.

Great things to come very soon! In the mean time, to learn more, checkout the
[Developer Community](https://developer.sailpoint.com/) or join the discussion
with other developers in the
[Developer Community forum](https://developer.sailpoint.com/discuss) to talk
about extending our platform, using the our tools, and more!
